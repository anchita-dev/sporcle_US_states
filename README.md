# sporcle_US_states
A Python-based interactive quiz game built using the turtle and pandas libraries. Inspired by Sporcle, the game challenges users to correctly name all 50 U.S. states. As the user types in correct state names, they appear on a U.S. map. The game tracks progress in real-time and saves missed states to a CSV for future learning.
