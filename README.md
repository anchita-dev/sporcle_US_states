# sporcle_US_states
A Python-based interactive quiz game built using the turtle and pandas libraries. Inspired by Sporcle, the game challenges users to correctly name all 50 U.S. states. As the user types in correct state names, they appear on a U.S. map. The game tracks progress in real-time and saves missed states to a CSV for future learning.

#About
This project was inspired by the popular quiz platform **Sporcle**. It uses Python’s `turtle` module to draw a map of the United States and allows users to guess the names of all 50 U.S. states. Correct guesses are displayed on the map, and unguessed states are saved to a CSV file for review.

#Features
- Interactive map with real-time state marking
- Keeps track of guessed and unguessed states
- CSV export of missed states
- Clean and intuitive GUI with 'turtle'

#Technologies Used
- Python 3
- 'turtle' (for drawing and GUI)
- 'pandas' (for handling CSV and data)
- CSV file (for state names and coordinates)
